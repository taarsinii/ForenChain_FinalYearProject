# ForenChain: Blockchain-Based Chain of Custody Management System for Digital Forensics
- A secure, tamper-proof, and transparent web-based system for managing digital evidence, designed to comply with **Malaysian forensic SOPs** and **legal standards** (Evidence Act 1950).
---
## ðŸ’¡ Project Vision
- Digital evidence must have a strong **Chain of Custody (CoC)** in order to be admissible in court. Existing approaches frequently use spreadsheets or paper forms, which are vulnerable to data loss, tampering, and human error.

The vision of ForenChain is to minimize these vulnerabilities by using **SHA-256 hash-chaining** and **Blockchain technology** to develop an unalterable, auditable, and verifiable record of evidence handling. This will ensure that the forensic lifecycle complies to the principles of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**.
---
## âœ¨ Key Features
* **Blockchain Hash Chaining:** All evidence recordings are linked using SHA-256, ensuring instant detection of any tampering attempts.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Provides secure access for various forensic roles (investigator, supervisor, analyst, prosecutor, administrator).
* **Audit Logs and Accountability:** All user activities are comprehensively logged for transparency purposes.
* **Dual-Consent Approval:** This simulates real-world forensic processes where supervisor approval is required for evidence actions.
